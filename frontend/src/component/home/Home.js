                             artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the study and education of the public. To
                             city leaders, an active museum community can be seen as a gauge of the cultural or economic
                             health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To museum
                             professionals, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission,
                             such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of
                             knowledge.[citation needed] In 1829, James Smithson's bequest funding the Smithsonian
                             Institution stated that he wanted to establish an institution "for the increase and diffusion of
                             knowledge".</p>

                            they inspired. Around the 4th century BC, Aristotle founded a mouseion at his Lyceum school for
                            the collection of specimens for his zoological studies.The Museum of Alexandria, erected by
                            Ptolemy I Soter around 300 BC, was the most famous museum of the ancient world. It was distinct
                            from the great Library of Alexandria, but just as vital to the protection and spread of
                            knowledge in the ancient world.The modern museum began to take shape during the Renaissance, as
                            a renewed interest in classical art and architecture drove wealthy merchant and banking families
                            to form collections of art as status symbols.</p>

                            and designated a philosophical institution or a place of contemplation. Use of the Latin
                            derivation, museum, appears to have been restricted in Roman times mainly to places of
                            philosophical discussion. Thus, the great Museum at Alexandria, founded by Ptolemy I Soter early
                            in the 3rd century BCE, with its college of scholars and its famous library, was more a
                            prototype university than an institution to preserve and interpret material aspects of one's
                            heritage. The word museum was revived in 15th-century Europe to describe the collection of
                            Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, but the term conveyed the concept of comprehensiveness rather
                            than denoting a building.
